			<h2>How to Make a Rustic Rope and Wood Tree Swing</h2>
			<p>We have a nice sized oak tree in our side yard that's been begging for a little rope swing. I did finally manage to put together a simple rope and wood swing for the tree. Once I started on it, the swing together in no time at all. I'm happy with my project and now I can show you how to make one too.</p>
			<p>Would you like to make one too?  (or get someone else to make it for you?) Here is how I did it:</p>
			<h3>Materials:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>2 by 6 piece of wood at least 6 foot long</li>
				<li>1 inch rope</li>
				<li>16 3 inch screws</li>
				<li>16 washers</li>
				<li>Stain or paint (optional)</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Cut the 2 by 6 in to 4 pieces. 2 that are 24 inches long and 2 that are 10 inches long.</li>
			<li>Assemble the pieces as shown below, drilling the screws into the wood. Use washers to ensure the screws don't come through to the other side.</li>
			<li>Add distressing if desired and sand down the swing seat.</li>
			<li>Use a 1 inch wood drill bit and drill 4 holes as shown:</li>
			<li>Paint or stain if desired.Cut two pieces of rope, 6 feet long and thread through the holes of the swing seat, tying a secure knot at the end of the ropes under the seat.</li>
			<li>Cut 2 more pieces of rope as long as you  need to reach your tree branch. Attach one end of the rope to the tree using a secure knot and the other end to the tree swing using a hitch knot. Repeat for the other side.</li>
